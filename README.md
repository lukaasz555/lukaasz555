    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
      ðŸ“š  I am a self-taught programmer focused on web development. 
      <br/>
      I am gaining my first experience in IT already by working as a Junior Developer.
      It's a part-time job where I am using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This job helped me to gain first experience with Docker, tools like Jira and now I have a better understanding of using Git.
   <br/><br />
      ðŸ”¥ Currently I am looking for a full-time job where I could develop my skills and learn from more experienced developers. <br />
      My main stack is <strong>React and TypeScript</strong>. I have also experience with <strong>Redux Toolkit, GraphQL, Node, Express, mongoDB, MySQL, TailwindCSS, SCSS.</strong>
